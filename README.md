ED#14 Oasis - Oaizs.com & OasisConnect

Oasis provides training and resources to current and future teachers in underserved regions for quality education. The Web-App, www.oaizs.com, is primarily developed using Django, a Python framework. Additionally, for accepting donations, we used Stripe.

However, in addition to software, our team developed OasisConnect. It creates a reliable network for schools, enabling access to oaizs.com without the need to connect to the internet.

It can be easily installed in any location where students gather to learn, enabling both teachers to access resources to ease their teachings or be a place where future teachers gather to access the online training that we offer. 

OasisConnect© is built using a Raspberry Pi 5 16GB, which we use to perform interesting functionalities. For example, we have the chance to host a small-language model, TinyLlama 1.1B parameters. It innovates in enabling teachers to use AI without connectivity to the internet, being useful, for example, for one of our functionalities: enabling teachers to tailor lessons based on student age, language, and literacy level.
